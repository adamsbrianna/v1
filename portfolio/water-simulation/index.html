                <h1>Shallow Water Simulation</h1>
                <img src=https://adamsbrianna.github.io/v1/img/portfolio/dam_break.gif style=max-width:100%>
                <p>The purpose of this project is to improve the performance of a shallow water simulation. This project
                  consists of three parts; the first two involve a parallelization of the code with OpenMP and a scaling
                  study to evaluate the performance with varying numbers of processors and problem sizes. Finally, the
                  code is profiled and tuned to optimize the simulation even further.</p>
                <p>three tasks:</p>
                <pre><code>Parallelization: You should parallelize your code using either MPI or OpenMP. You may try both if you have time.

Scaling study: You should run strong and weak scaling studies analyses on Graphite and/or Comet.

Profiling and tuning: Using either profiling tools or manual instrumentation, look for bottlenecks in the code. Your goal is to get the implementation to run as quickly as possible. This may involve a domain decomposition (useful even in the serial case, as we have seen); it may involve vectorization of the computational kernels; or it may involve eliminating redundant computations. Note that I have already done some serial tuning, so higher-level optimizations (time step batching, blocking) are likely to be more effective than low-level tuning for vectorization.
</code></pre>
                <p>Structured grid computations are particularly common in fluid dynamics simulations, and the code that
                  tune is an example of such a simulation. You will be optimizing and parallelizing a finite volume
                  solver for the shallow water equations, a two-dimensional PDE system that describes waves that are
                  very long compared to the water depth. This is an important system of equations that applies even in
                  situations that you might not initially think of as &ldquo;shallow&rdquo;; for example, tsunami waves
                  are long enough that they can be modeled using the shallow water equations even when traveling over
                  mile-deep parts of oceans.</p>
                <p>The parallelization of the code uses OpenMP. The problem domain is divided into subdomains and each
                  subdomain is handled by a thread, allowing for parallel processing of the computations.
                  We ran experiments on Comet to evaluate how the parallelized problem scales.<br>
                  The speedup plot shows an increase in speed with an increase in processors and a maximum speedup of
                  24.08 with 24 processors which lines up with the expectation that the speedup should be less than or
                  equal to the number of processors. The slight variance between these values is likely negligible and
                  stems from minute changes among running the script or overheads of managing the threads.</p>
                <p>In order to evaluate the execution of the code and discover potential bottlenecks the code was
                  profiled with gperftools and valgrind/callgrind. Vectorization is another method that we experimented
                  with for optimization. The profiling results indicate that the functions calculating the limited
                  derivatives might profit from tuning, so we attempted vectorization of some of the involved
                  functions.Combining the vectorization of both limited_deriv functions reduces the execution time from
                  13.9s to 10.6s Increasing the number of threads to 24 on Comet leads to an execution time of 2.911994s
                  without vectorization and 2.219870s with vectorization. This brings the speedup from around 24.1 to
                  31.6.</p>
                <p>Through parallelisation and some vectorization we were able to drastically reduce the execution
                  latency of the simulation. Our efforts resulted in a speedup of 31.6 for a problem of size 1000, run
                  on comet with 24 threads. These results were in line with the speedup that we predicted in our
                  performance model.</p>
