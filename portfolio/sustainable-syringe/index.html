<h1>Sustainable Syringe</h1>
<p>Fifth abundantly made Give sixth hath. Cattle creature i be don&rsquo;t them.</p>
<p>65 million vaccines a year in the US alone…
65 million syringes to administer them
Twice as many vials and needles
Vaccines are not just given domestically, pets are given vaccines worldwide
Identifies a new problem
No other design has solved the issue of both space and efficiency of vaccines that need to be mixed</p>
<p>Potential to make a large-scale and/or global impact on animal healthcare
Human error with selecting wrong diluent
Reduces time spent preparing vaccine</p>
<p>Currently, dual chambered syringes exist in the human healthcare field but this solution has not been applied to veterinary medicine. Our two compartment syringe allows the lyophilized portion or “powder” of vaccine to remain in a separate outside compartment from the diluent which lives in the inner compartment. When the plunger is pulled up, the liquid is able to mix with the powder and the vaccine can be shaken and administered as normal.
Our product’s design, sustainable nature and opportunity for more efficient administration make it truly unique from anything that exists on the market.</p>
<p>Solution could be readily commercialized and the market size is large
Cheaper because glass can be sanitized and reused (maybe don’t mention material)
Less packaging involved so less manufacturing
Less time preparing vaccines which means more time can go into other tasks
The market - all veterinary practices</p>
<p>***can’t be readily commercialized but a new sort of packaging can</p>
<p>Manufacturing process:
•Make vials to the required dimension
•Bake the cake in the oven (in the vial per standards)
•Fill sterile liquid in another vial/plunger in the closed position
•Insert the vial containing liquid into the next vial containing the cake
•Fix the two vials using a stopper</p>
<p>27,000 - that’s the number of vaccines that Dr Taylor, a general practitioner at a 4 doctor practice will give in one year.
That’s 60 million vaccines given annually nationwide. There’s a problem staring us in the face: waste. 60 million syringes and twice as many needles and vials, not accounting for their packaging that are thrown away after use.
And let’s talk about time- it would take me longer to reconstitute one vaccine than it would to give you this pitch. Seriously, it is a highly inefficient process.
EcoVax’s solution not only simplifies the traditional vaccine delivery system but also provides cleaner packaging options to address the flaws in our current practices.
Meet CRIS = Compact reconstitution injection system
Our unique design provides an all in one storage, reconstitution, and administration system. All you have to do is add a needle. Pulling up the plunger allows the diluent in the inner chamber to enter the outer chamber and mix with the lyophilized powder and then be administered. This system reduces the 8-9 pieces of waste associated with traditional vaccine systems to 4 and increases the efficiency of vaccine reconstitution into 3 simple steps - pull, shake, and push.
(Address size issues with current prefilled syringes)
Preliminary research estimates a 35% reduction in overall production costs achieving breakeven in one year with an initial market penetration of 1.9%. (add a tie in)
Our sustainable packaging solutions include a biodegradable polylactic acid plastic container with angular snap fittings for secure shipping and storage as mocked up here. We also have reusable cooling system incorporating post industrial fibers and an option for clinics to opt into an incentivized closed recycling loop.
Shifting to renewable and recyclable packaging options cuts down on 50% of packaging associated waste. (Add something here)
Ultimately, our health is codependent. Innovations should lead to a healthier environment, healthier animals and healthier people. We have to start taking responsibility for the impact the products we use every day can make and move towards creating conscientious products that benefit all or we risk reaching for the future at the price of the land we stand on.</p>
