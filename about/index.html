                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p>I&rsquo;m an undergrad at Cornell University majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Fine Art.
                  During a summer of research, I did object oriented design and teaching for a program for high
                  schoolers without CS experience to expose them to topics in networking and computer security. They
                  (and, really, I along the way) learned about (D)DOS attacks and learning switches. I discovered a
                  fondness for education while being able to work with these students and to watch their eyes light up
                  with things finally “clicked".</p>
                <p>However, I’m not just interested in education; I have a lot of passion for social impact. My interest
                  broadly gravitate towards accessibility, diversity and equality, and sustainability. I’m super open to
                  trying new things and learning about new projects. In short, in addition to my interest in purely the
                  subject of computer science, I’m driven by the thought of applying CS to social good and positively
                  impacting the lives of others. I also enjoy figure skating, hiking, and community service :)</p>
