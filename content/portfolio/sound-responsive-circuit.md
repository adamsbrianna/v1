A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth.

## Header Level 2

Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

Project 1: Interactive surface design responding to sound (20%) 
Due: 11/9 (Tuesday) at the beginning of class  
Submission: Code file (if you modified or developed yourself) 
                      and Powerpoint slides to Canvas 
                      Complete surface design to 121 HEB 
The goal of the project is to create an interactive surface design that responds to sound input, 
including the human voice or music. The surface design needs to be realized with flexible 
materials and embedded electronics operated by Micro-Python programming. Students are 
encouraged to apply a variety of surface design techniques such as origami, laser cutting, 
pleating, free-motion stitches, digital printing, applique, felting, and smocking, which can create 
unique surface and 3D effect enhanced by light from LEDs. 
Requirements include the use of Circuit Playground Express (CPX), 8-12 LEDs, a toggle 
switch, and a potentiometer. Pulse Width Modulation needs to be employed to adjust the output 
level from the actuators (LEDs). The finished project should be a stand-alone system that does 
not need to be connected to an external power source or computing device. The surface design 
should present unique aesthetic enhanced by light from LEDs. Materials for your surface design 
can be any flexible materials (including, but not limited to paper and fabrics) which can create 
unique shape, geometry, texture or 3D effect. 
Grading rubric • Unique aesthetics enhanced by light from LED (8 pts.)
• Circuit design and prototyping (7pts.)
• Three page slides (5 pts.)
Page 1 includes title of your work, your name, 3 keywords to best describe your work, 
and a video clip showing how your project responds to your favorite music/sound in a 
dark environment (15 sec.)
Page 2 includes about 5 sentences to justify unique aesthetics enhanced by light and your 
inspiration with an image
Page 3 includes a few sentences and photos of your work process (e.g. initial sketch, 
finished circuit, material fabrication/manipulation)
Recommendation 
• If you consider maximizing impact of LED on your surface design, consider using light
reflective materials (e.g., beads, small craft mirrors with sticker backing that can be
placed near LEDs, reflective tape, metallic fabric, etc.)
• If you don’t want the LEDs to look like Christmas decoration, consider using only one
color LEDs or/and dimming LEDs by putting a thin layer of poly-fill, tracing paper,
cotton/polyester batting on top of your circuit to diffuse the light.
• Spend enough time for search of inspiration, material fabrication/manipulation and
checking impact of LEDs on your surface design.
• Inspiration search: You may consider searching unique geometry, shape, texture and light
design in the field of architecture, textile art/design, interior design, and home décor.
• Plan to complete design and wiring of your circuit during in-class sessions during
October.
