The goal of this project was to create an interactive surface design that responds to sound input, 
including the human voice or music. The surface design was created with felt, magnets, polyester fiberfill, and wires. It's embedded with electronics operated by Micro-Python. Twelve LED lights, a potentiometer, toggle switch, and CPX were used. The pulse width modulation was designed to adjust the output 
level from the LEDs. The finished project is a stand-alone system that does not need to be connected to an external power source or computing device.
