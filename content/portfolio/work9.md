Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean.

Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar.

Personal Growth Report:

For strengths, I think that going into the hackathon I didn’t know a lot. I’m a CS major in the college of engineering and hackathons are always being talked about, and I always figured, you know, it would probably be good experience to try one out sometime. Last semester, my lab partner was wearing an animal health hackathon shirt and I had gotten some email prior and seen advertising around campus of the event. This, in combination with a growing interest in participating in a hackathon, lead me to ask her what she thought of it. She said that she had thought it was fun and that it was a good hackathon especially if I’ve had no experience in one before. So, I signed up. Fast forward next semester, I enroll in the class and attend the first day – I’m surrounded largely by graduate students and vet students and there were only two familiar faces in the room. A very different experience than I am used to. I considered for a little while if I should even continue taking the class because maybe I wouldn’t fit in or wouldn’t have enough experience. But, armed with my friend’s words that it could be a good experience and a desire to try something new, I decided to stay.

I ended up joining a group that had very different experiences and talents than mine. My team members consisted of three vet students, two MBAs (one with another masters degree in mechanical engineering), and me, an undergrad in computer science. From a member on my team I learned to be flexible. Our speaker needed notecards and she went out of her way to drive home and pick up notecards from her apartment. From another member, I learned to be humble and to listen. We were redesigning a syringe and the mechanical engineer on our team never took over or made it his space. He listened to everyones’ ideas and thought patiently. He would make suggestions here and there but stayed very open minded. This impressed me because he has a lot of technical experience and I would’ve thought he might want to take charge of the situation, but he didn’t. He just contributed thoughtfully. From another member I learned to go above and beyond. She, after the first day, did lots of research so that in the morning she came prepared with lots of knowledge and voluntarily gave pitches and spoke for our final presentation.

From this experience I grew by committing to a topic I had never known about before for an entire weekend. I think I am more willing to tackle new experiences and be more open to participating in another hackathon. This is because I have gone through this experience of being someone with a different background than many of my teammates and, while not having won, still being very happy with the product we designed and what we presented. Character was built largely by persevering. We had gone through multiple design iterations before going back again to one of our initial designs. This was a very tedious, time intensive process because it almost felt like going back to square one and on top of this, we had criticism from sponsors and mentors. Overall, we took this feedback and improved.

Lastly, I think this experience highlighted different strengths and weaknesses I have in a couple of different ways. In terms of strengths I felt I was able to contribute a lot by brainstorming and degenerating new ideas. In addition, I felt I made thoughtful comments through analyzing my teammates designs and communicating with big picture ideas like making a timeline for the weekend and noticing when we would be spending too much time on one thing. In terms of weaknesses I sometimes felt out of place in terms of my experience. The vet students I feel were able to contribute a lot because they know the different procedures and have had first hand experience with the inconvenience and the waste the design we were trying to improve upon produces. In addition, the MBA students had great marketing skills and knew how to create financial models and small but important details about manufacturing processes. I, on the other hand, felt like I didn’t have any immediately applicable skills because I haven’t gotten far enough on my education track to execute the tools I will learn. However, I enjoyed my experience and can always try again in the next hackathon.

From the information delivered in the hackathon measuring the weight of horses because this could potentially be done using artificial intelligence and image recognition software or even through literal horse shoes and weight sensors. Additionally, the way people pay off bills from a veterinary clinic or the way veterinarians are treated along with many other topics have been or have the potential to be disrupted by advances in healthcare technology. One of the largest examples of how this could potentially be executed is with mobile device applications. Apps can be used by clinics to distribute surveys to their veterinarians on their wellbeing, their workload, and their overall mental health. Apps could be used to scan products in a clinic and determine whether or not they are recyclable instead of having to call up the manufacturer. Apps could connect pet owners with services and donations to help support the owners financially during an emergency involving their pet. Apps have the potential to innovate in many other fields as well, these were just a few examples I’ve learned about.

One solution that was proposed that would make life easier for both the owner and the pet would be a “bio” bandaid because the dog would no longer have to wear and uncomfortable cone around its neck and the owner would not have to feel bad for the dog. This example highlights how healthcare technology can be used to solve a problem of guilt and comfort. Advancing healthcare technology could also improve about the large amounts of waste that is being generated in healthcare. Technology does not only mean gadgets with electricity it is also used to refer to general changes and advancements in application. So, advancing the design and system of packaging is one example that could solve the problem of sustainability. Lastly, Healthcare technology can be used to create value by solving a problem that has never been tackled before.
