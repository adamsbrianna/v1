This idea was made for an animal health hackathon and inspired from the excessive waste produced from reconstituting veterinary vaccines. 
> 65 million vaccines are given in a year in the US alone.

Vaccines are not just given domestically, pets are given vaccines worldwide. No other design has solved the issue of both space and efficiency of vaccines that need to be mixed. In addition, it reduces human error with selecting wrong diluent and reduces time spent preparing vaccines.

Currently, dual chambered syringes exist in the human healthcare field but this solution has not been applied to veterinary medicine. This was a collaborative effort coming from MBA students, vet students, and undergrads. The two compartment syringe design allows the “powder” of the vaccine to remain in a separate outside compartment from the diluent which lives in the inner compartment. When the plunger is pulled up, the liquid is able to mix with the powder and the vaccine can be shaken and administered as normal.

Our unique design provides an all in one storage, reconstitution, and administration system. All that needs to be added is a needle. Pulling up the plunger allows the diluent in the inner chamber to enter the outer chamber and mix with the lyophilized powder and then be administered. This system reduces the 8-9 pieces of waste associated with traditional vaccine systems to 4 and increases the efficiency of vaccine reconstitution into 3 simple steps - pull, shake, and push. 

Our sustainable packaging solutions include a biodegradable polylactic acid plastic container with angular snap fittings for secure shipping and storage. Shifting to renewable and recyclable packaging options cuts down on 50% of packaging associated waste.
