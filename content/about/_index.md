I have a lot of passion for social impact. My interests broadly gravitate towards accessibility, diversity and equality, and sustainability. I’m super open to trying new things and learning about new projects. In short, in addition to my interest in purely the subject of computer science, I’m driven by the thought of applying CS to social good and positively impacting the lives of others. I also enjoy figure skating, hiking, and community service 😊
